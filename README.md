React Pagination Feature
In this project, I have developed a simple pagination feature using React. Pagination is a common feature that makes navigating large datasets, such as a food menu, more user-friendly.

How Does It Work?
The 'Menu' component takes all the food items as a list and determines the number of items to display per page.

To enable pagination, a set of numbered links is presented to the user at the bottom, allowing them to navigate between different pages.

Users can also use 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons to move between pages.

Depending on the size of the dataset, the pagination automatically refreshes and updates the appropriate page count.

This pagination feature enhances user experience and allows them to easily access and navigate through large datasets.
